# Semantic-Segmentation
Introduction
Semantic segmentation is a type of image segmentation, which is the process of partitioning an image into multiple regions or segments. In semantic segmentation, each pixel in the image is assigned a label that identifies the object or scene that it represents. Semantic segmentation has a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics.
